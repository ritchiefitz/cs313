		<p>
			I was born in Grand Junction, Colorado, and raised in Moab, UT and Rexburg, ID. Since I was a kid 
			there have been three areas of interest I have always had, science, math, and music. When I was 
			in elementary school I auditioned and became a part of Rexburg Boy's Choir. That was a great 
			experience for me. Since I was young I have always loved to play sports. I played every sport 
			except soccer. When I was younger I was more into baseball and then it faded into Basketball. 
			I have always loved watching football, but I didn't like playing it as much as the others.

			For a small time I attended Idaho Leadership Academy. It was really fun and interesting for the year and 
			a half that I did it. We learned and studied a lot of classical works. We read classical books, and 
			studied Euclid, and we were able to learn about a lot of the great leaders of the world. At the end 
			of the first year I was chosen as the schools valedictorian. That was a great honor. After this 
			though I missed the social scene of public school and everything it had to offer for different 
			activities and groups.
