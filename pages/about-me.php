			While in the classical choir, our choir was chosen from 100's of other highschool's from across 
			the country to perform in Carnegie Hall in New York City. It was so fun to see the big city 
			coming from a small community in Idaho it was incredible. While in High School I was chosen 
			to be Junior Class Senator, and Senior Class Vice President. Both awesome opportunities to 
			take a part in, and learning about leadership roles. Besides choir I also joined the debate 
			team and me and my partner took 2nd place at one championship, sadly I only participated my 
			junior year, but it was fun while it lasted. One of my funnest events in high school was 
			called Mr. Madison. I don't know if your school has something similar to these events but the 
			girls in Idaho take part of an event called Junior Miss (it is a beauty pageant like Miss 
			America), and Mr. Madison just makes fun of Junior Miss. Not that it means very much but I won, 
			and it was the funnest funniest thing I have taken a part in.

			After high school I got accepted into BYU-I. When I first started I didn't really know what I 
			was going to major in but computers was definitely at the top of the list. After my second 
			course in computer science I decided that was the course that I wanted to take. While attending 
			BYU-I I met my wife Hannah Walker, and not even two years later we had our first child. Her name 
			is Leah. I thought that it would be harder to continue learning being married and having kid so 
			young, but that would be wrong. If anything I now have more ambition and wanting to learn more 
			so that I can provide for my family. In my life I have always decided to put family first, work 
			second. Family is the single most important thing to me, and if a future employer disagrees then 
			I won't think twice about turning down an offer.
