		<p>
			I started getting interested in Computer Science when I was about 12 years old. My cousin, 
			Richard, and I started making games with GameMaker. It was a lot of fun as a kid, and I enjoyed 
			watching others play the games I made. Since then my passion for learning more about computers 
			has increased exponentially. I didn’t really do much more than that since I was a kid till college.
		</p>

			At college I was trying to decide what to major in because I had a lot of different interests. 
			Computers stuck out to me, and I decided to give it a try. My first class was the hardest. My 
			class at first had 30-40 kids in it, but in the end it ended up being around 5-8. I learned a 
			lot, but I really fell in love with it in my second class. After that I decided that that is 
			what I needed to do. I now am getting my major in Computer Information Technologies and my minor 
			n Computer Science. My first internship was with Barton Consulting, they build websites, it was 
			fun to get into that realm more and now I can easily build a websites using many different tools. 
			I also worked for AMD as a computer scientist, building a python GUI program to help them 
			validate certain things. It was an awesome project and I was able to learn a lot.
		</p>
		<p>
			Along the way I have been using and teaching myself many different languages, and I haven’t used 
			all of these in building projects but I have used all of them in coding before.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>C++</li>
			<li>Java</li>
			<li>HTML5</li>
			<li>CSS3</li>
			<li>JavaScript</li>
			<li>jQuery</li>
			<li>PHP</li>
			<li>Python</li>
			<li>Ruby</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The ones I have built real programs for have been Java, HTML5, CSS3, PHP, JavaScript, jQuery, 
			python and ruby. I have learned all I know though with C++. Learning C++ was helpful because I 
			know what is going on more behind the scenes with these other languages. To see more what I have 
			done look at my portfolio page and resume for a detailed work history and you could even take a 
			look at my linkedin page.
